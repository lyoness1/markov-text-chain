Head under water.
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while.
The breathing gets harder, even I know that.
Made room for me but it's too soon to see.
If I'm happy in your hands.
I'm unusually hard to hold on to.
.
Blank stares at blank pages.
No easy way to say this.
You mean well, but you make this hard on me.
.
I'm not gonna write you a love song.
'cause you asked for it.
'cause you need one, you see.
I'm not gonna write you a love song.
'cause you tell me it's make or break in this.
If you're on your way.
I'm not gonna write you to stay.
If all you have is leaving I'ma need a better reason to write you a love song today, today.
.
I learned the hard way.
That they all say things you want to hear.
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you and your twisted words,.
Your help just hurts.
You are not what I thought you wereI must be crazy now.
Maybe I dream too much.
But when I think of you.
I long to feel your touch.
.
To whisper in your ear.
Words that are old as time.
Words only you would hear.
If only you were mine.
.
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you.
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes.
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do.
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side.
.
I love you, please say.
You love me too, these three words.
They could change our lives forever.
And I promise you that we will always be together.
Till the end of time.
.
So today, I finally find the courage deep inside.
Just to walk right up to your door.
But my body can't move when I finally get to it.
Just like a thousand times before.
.
Then without a word he handed me this letter.
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said.
.
I love you, please say.
You love me too, these three words.
They could change our lives forever.
And I promise you that we will always be together.
Till the end of time.
.
Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah.
And maybe I, I need a little care.
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you.
Oh you need somebody just to hold you.
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there.
.
I love you, please say.
You love me too.
Please say you love me too.
Till the end of timeLa la.
La la la la.
La la.
La la la.
I like your smile.
I like your vibe.
I like your style.
But that's not why I love you.
.
And I, I like the way.
You're such a star.
But that's not why I love you.
Hey.
Do you feel, do you feel me?.
Do you feel what I feel, too?.
Do you need, do you need me?.
Do you need me?.
.
[Chorus:].
You're so beautiful.
But that's not why I love you.
I'm not sure you know.
That the reason I love you is you.
Being you.
Just you.
Yeah the reason I love you is all that we've been through.
And that's why I love you.
.
La la.
La la la la.
La la.
La la la.
I like the way you misbehave.
When we get wasted.
But that's not why I love you.
And how you keep your cool.
When I am complicated.
But that's not why I love you.
.
Hey.
Do you feel, do you feel me?.
Do you feel what I feel, too?.
Do you need, do you need me?.
.
Do you need me?.
.
[Chorus].
You're so beautiful.
But that's not why I love you.
And I'm not sure you know.
That the reason I love you is you.
Being you.
Just you.
Yeah the reason I love you is all that we've been through.
And that's why I love you.
.
Yeah - Oh..
Oh..
.
Even though we didn't make it throughI fell in love with a beautiful girl.
and she still takes my breath away.
I fell in love in the morning sun.
while the hours slipped away.
Sometimes when I hear your name.
a smile creeps on my face,.
And for reasons I can't explain.
It's never out of place.
.
'Cause I love you.
More than you think I do.
And I love you.
Now you don't want me to.
'Cause I love you.
More than you think I do.
And I love you.
Now you don't want me to.
.
You ran your finger down back.
and you spelled out your name.
While we lay there on the soft warm ground.
for a week and thirteen days.
.
And I know it sounds so wrong.
And you've heard all this before.
I didn't come back and I wasn't there.
I won't trouble you no more.
.
'Cause I love you.
More than you think I do.
And I love you.
Now you don't want me to.
'Cause I love you.
More than you think I do.
And I love you.
Now you don't want me to.
.
Every time I try to fight it.
Everything just turns out wrong.
Maybe if I got my timing right.
I wouldn't end up alone.
.
I fell in love with a beautiful boy.
And he still takes my breath away.
.
When you left it was the end of my world.
'cause I never got to say.
.
That I love you.
More than you think I do.
And I love you.
Now you don't want me to.
'Cause I love you ('Cause I love you).
More than you think I do.
And I love you (I love you).
Now you don't want me to.
.
'Cause I love you.
Woah oh woah oh woah oh.
Woah oh woah oh woah oh.
And I love you.
.
I am always here for you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
.
[Chorus:].
You're so beautiful.
But that's not why I love you.
I'm not sure you know.
That the reason I love you is you.
Being you.
Just you.
Yeah the reason I love you is all that we've been through.
And that's why I love you.

These three words.
They could change our lives forever.
And I promise you that we will always be together.
.
Oh, I love you.
Please say you love me too.
Please please.
Say you love me too.
Till the end of time.
My baby.
Together, together, forever.
Till the end of time.
I love you.
I will be your light.
Shining bright.
Shining through your eyes.
My baby.
.
Hello to high and dry.
.
Convinced me to please you.
Made me think that I need this too.
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am.
.
I'm not gonna write you a love song.
'cause you asked for it.
'cause you need one, you see.
I'm not gonna write you a love song.
'cause you tell me it's make or break in this.
If you're on your way.
I'm not gonna write you to stay.
If all you have is leaving I'ma need a better reason to write you a love song today.
.
Promise me that you'll leave the light on.
To help me see with daylight, my guide, gone.
'cause I believe there's a way you can love me.
Because I say.
.
I won't write you a love song.
'cause you asked for it.
'cause you need one, you see.
I'm not gonna write you a love song.
'cause you tell me it's make or break in this.
.
Is that why you wanted a love song?.
'cause you asked for it.
'cause you need one, you see.
I'm not gonna write you a love song.
'cause you tell me it's make or break in this.
If you're on your way.
I'm not gonna write you to stay.
If your heart is nowhere in it.
I don't want it for a minute.
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas when I believe that there's a reason to write you a love song today, today.
And if you really love me won't you tell me...
And if you really love me won't you tell me...
And if you really love me won't you tell me...
Then I won't have to be .
Playing around .
.
You call my name.
Oooh so sweet.
To make your kiss incompleteWhat a wonderful world .
I see trees of green, red roses too.
I see them bloom from me and you.
But I think to myself what a wonderful world (yeah).
.
I see skies of blue, clouds of white.
bright blessed days, dark sacred nights.
but i think to myself what a wonderful world.
.
The colours of the rainbow so pretty in the sky.
Are also on the faces of people passing by.
I see friends shakin' hands saying "How do you do?".
They're really saying "I love you".
.
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow.
They'll learn much more than I'll never know.
But I think to myself what a wonderful world.
.
I think to myself what a wonderful world.
Hey, yeah, wonderful, wonderful world.
.
The colours of the rainbow so pretty in the sky.
Are also on the faces of people passing by.
I see friends shakin' hands saying "How do you do?".
They're really saying "I love you" .
.
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow.
They'll learn much more than I'll never know.
.
But I think to myself what a wonderful world.
I think to myself what a wonderful world.
Hey, yeah, wonderful, wonderful world.
When your mood is clear.
You quickly change your ways.
Then you say I'm untrue.
What am I supposed to do.
Be a fool who sits alone waiting for you .
.
But if you really love me won't you tell me...
But if you really love me won't you tell me...
And if you really love me won't you tell me...
Then I won't have to be .
Playing around .
.
I see the light of your smile.
Calling me all the while.
You are saying baby.
It's time to go....
First the feeling's alright.
Then it's gone from sight.
So I'm taking out this time to say .
Some people wish.
Some people dance.
Some never take a chance.
Some people steal.
Just for the thrill.
And some drink to get their fill.
But I love you.
.
Some people preach.
Some people write.
And some choose to just stay quiet.
Some people teach.
Some people roam.
Some would rather be alone.
But I love you, yeah.
.
Some people hurt.
Some people laugh.
And some just don't know what they have.
But I love you.
.
Baby I love you, yeah.
.
Oh if you really love me won't you tell me...
Oh if you really love me won't you tell me...
And if you really love me won't you tell me...
Then I won't have to be .
